<h3>The Internet of Things (IoT) defines the network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to communicate and share data over the Internet with other devices and systems. <br></br>These devices range from common household items to sophisticated industrial instruments. Experts today expect this number to rise to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025 with more than 7 billion IoT devices connected to it. <br></br>Briefly,  (IoT) refers to a large number of "things" linked to the Internet, so that they can exchange data with other things. <br></br>A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address and is able to transfer data over a network.</h3>
