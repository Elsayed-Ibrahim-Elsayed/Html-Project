<h1> <u> History of internet of things</u></h1>
<h3>Entrepreneur Kevin Ashton, one of the founders of the MIT Auto-ID Centre, coined the word "Internet of Things." Ashton was part of a team that discovered how an RFID tag could link objects to the internet. In a 1999 lecture, he used the term "Internet of Things" for the first time – and it has since stuck around.<br></br> 
    Ashton may have been first to use the term Internet of Things, but the concept of connected devices – particularly connected machines – has been around for a long time. For example, machines have been communicating with each other since the first electric telegraphs were developed in the late 1830s.<br></br> Other technologies that fed into IoT were radio voice transmissions, wireless (Wi-Fi) technologies and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software. Then in 1982, a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University became the first connected smart appliance. Using the university’s local Ethernet or ARPANET – a precursor to today’s internet – students could find out which drinks were stocked, and whether they were cold</h3>
