<h1><u>Future of internet of things (IOT)</u></h1>
<h3>The future of IoT has the potential to be limitless. Advances to the industrial internet will be accelerated through increased network agility, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and the capacity to deploy, automate, orchestrate and secure diverse use cases at hyperscale, The ability is not only to simultaneously allow billions of devices, but to exploit the enormous amounts of actionable data that can automate various business processes.<br></br>As networks and IoT systems grow to address these obstacles, service providers will also edge into IT and web-scale markets through expanded capacity and AI – opening up whole new revenue streams </h3>
<ol> <h3>Here are 3 predictions about the future of IoT
<li>Cars will get even smarter: The arrival of 5G will shift the auto industry into a higher gear. The development of driverless cars — as well as the connected vehicles already on the road — will benefit from data moving faster. .<br></br>You might not think of your car as an Internet of Things device. But new cars will increasingly analyze your data and connect with other IoT devices — including other high-tech vehicles on four wheels. </li>
<li>Security and privacy concerns will drive legislation and regulatory activity: The increase in IoT devices is just one reason security and privacy concerns are rising. In mid-2018, the European Union implemented the General Data Protection Regulation. .<br></br> GDPR has led to similar security and privacy initiatives in several nations around the world. In the United States, California recently passed a tougher privacy law. What does this mean for you? Such efforts could give you more control over your data. </li>
<li>More cities will become “smart”: Consumers won’t be the only ones using IoT devices. Cities and companies will increasingly adopt smart technologies to save time and money. <br></br>That means cities will be able to automate, remotely manage, and collect data through things like visitor kiosks, video camera surveillance systems, bike rental stations, and taxis. </li> </h3></ol>
